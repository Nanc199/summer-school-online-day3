        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Hi, I’m Nancy, a 5th semester student pursuing B.Tech in CSE (Artificial Intelligence & Data Science) at Government Hydro Engineering College, Bilaspur.
          I am passionate about combining logic with creativity—whether it’s solving algorithmic challenges or designing web interfaces. I enjoy exploring both frontend and backend development.
          Currently, I'm sharpening my skills in Full Stack Web Development, and learning new technologies like React and Node.js....

        <h2>Web-dev @IIT Jammu</h2>
        <p>
          I'm learning full-stack web development at IIT Jammu. The hands-on assignments, mentorship, and project-based learning have really boosted my confidence and skills in both frontend and backend.
          I learned to work with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Node.js. Weekly assignments and real-time feedback helped me understand both frontend structure and backend logic effectively....

        <h2>Chess Journey</h2>
        <p>
          I started playing chess during my time in college. It quickly became more than just a game — it sharpened my thinking, boosted my patience, and helped me stay calm under pressure.
          Playing friendly matches with classmates became a great way to bond and grow mentally.

        <h2>Coding</h2>
        <p>
          I’ve explored programming through C, C++, and Python. These projects helped me build logic, understand syntax, and solve real problems step-by-step.
